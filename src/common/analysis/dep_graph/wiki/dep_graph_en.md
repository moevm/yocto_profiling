## Dependency Graph Construction

To build the dependency graph, the file `task-depends.dot` is required, which can be obtained using the following command: `bitbake -g core-image-sato`.

After obtaining the `task-depends.dot` file, we can build the dependency graph. The dependency graph was constructed in two ways:

1) Using Python with the `plotly.graph_objects` library, an `.html` file was created containing the visualization of the dependency graph:

In this file, it is possible to zoom in on specific parts of the graph; for example, letâ€™s look at the node `core-image-sato.do_rootfs`:

2) The same dependency graph was also built using Graphia; in this case, the visualization of the graph is three-dimensional. The appearance of the graph:

It is also possible to find a node by search and zoom in on a specific node.

For `core-image-sato`, the resulting graph consisted of 8782 nodes and 33883 edges.

## Questions Regarding the Dependency Graph

The main question is whether the dependency graph has a root; in that case, it would be more convenient to perform traversal.
